# JS ES6 function tests

Messing around with recursive functions in ES6.

Will die on big inputs until browsers implement ES6's proper tail calls.

## Cons lists

Also messing around with lists a-la SICP.

## Running

Only uses ES6 features available by default in Firefox nightly. Might need to transpile in other places.
